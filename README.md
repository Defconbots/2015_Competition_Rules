# Defconbots 2015 - Tower Defense - Rules

These are the official rules for the defconbots 2015, tower defense, competition.

If you have questions or comments about the rules create an issue in this repository.

## Spirit of the Contest

 * Build an autonomous robot with an aiming mechanism and a laser
 * Write software for the robot to accurately aim and shoot the laser at moving and illuminated targets

Robots that go against the spirit of the contest will be disqualified. Examples of this would be a robot that randomly sweeps the laser across the Arena or is secretly remote controlled.

## Robot

### Physical

 * Must fit within 1 x 1 x 1 meter cube
 * Must be easy to move and stage for competition quickly (< 5 minutes)

### Software

 * Autonomous (no remote control)

### Shooting Device

 * One(1) five milliwatt (5mW) Green laser
 * The laser must be capable of encoding a 4800 baud serial signal
 * No specific laser is required but it is strongly recommended you use the laser used to develop the targets (http://www.civillaser.com/532nm-5mw50mw-ttl-modulation-green-laser-module-dot-16mmx70mm-p-130.html)
 * If a mirror is used to direct your laser it must not distort your laser beam (cannot be concave or convex)
 * The robot should only emit one laser beam (beam-splitters may be used internally but the robot may not emit multiple beams)

# Competition Mechanics

## Arena
 
 * TBD x TBD meters (See conceptual layout http://i.imgur.com/4RzQxc4.png)
 * Ground will be flat-black in color

## Targets

 * TBD targets
 * TBD cm off the ground
 * 12.5 cm apart
 * TBD shape
 * White surface color

## Waves

 * Each wave starts at a specific point on the track
 * Initially all targets are illuminated and "alive"
 * TBD
 * If there is a problem with the track or targets during a wave the event coordinators reserve the right to halt the wave and restart it (we will try our best to never let this happen!)

## How to win
